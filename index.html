            <h2>POEM OF THE ONE WORLD</h1>
            <p> This morning <br>
                the beautiful white heron <br>
                was floating along above the water
            </p>
            <p>
                and then into the sky of this <br>
                the one world <br>
                we all belong to
            </p>
            <p>
                where everything <br>
                sooner or later <br>
                is a part of everything else
            </p>
            <p> 
                which thought made me feel <br>
                for a little while <br>
                quite beautiful myself
            </p>
